## About

This repository contains a Flutter-based portfolio application meant to showcase projects, skills, and contact information. It's arranged as a multi-platform Flutter app so it can run on mobile (Android/iOS), web, and desktop platforms (Windows/macOS/Linux).

> **Note:** The repository appears to be scaffolded by Flutter (`pubspec.yaml`, platform folders, `lib/`, `assets/`, `test/`, etc.).

## Features (examples)

* Responsive UI for multiple platforms (mobile, web, desktop)
* Single codebase (Dart/Flutter)
* Organized assets folder for images, icons, fonts
* Platform-specific folders maintained by Flutter
* Unit and widget test folder (`test/`) ready for adding tests

## Preview

Screenshots of the repo root and file structure are included in the project (or were provided when requesting this README).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

* [Flutter SDK (stable)](https://flutter.dev) (>= stable channel matching app's SDK)
* Dart (bundled with Flutter)
* Android Studio / Xcode (for Android / iOS development)
* Chrome (for web), or required desktop toolchains for Windows/macOS/Linux
* A code editor (VS Code, IntelliJ/Android Studio)

Confirm installation:

```bash
flutter --version
```

## Getting started (run locally)

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

2. Fetch dependencies:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

3. Run on a connected device or emulator:

```bash
# Run on the default device
flutter run

# Run on Chrome (web)
flutter run -d chrome

# Run on a specific platform (example: Windows)
flutter run -d windows
```

4. Build release bundles:

```bash
# Android (APK)
flutter build apk --release

# iOS (ipa / archive - requires macOS)
flutter build ios --release

# Web
flutter build web --release

# Windows
flutter build windows --release

# macOS
flutter build macos --release

# Linux
flutter build linux --release
```

### `lib/`

This is the heart of the project. Typical contents you should expect and keep organized:

* `main.dart` — the app entrypoint
* `src/` or `screens/` — screen widgets (Home, About, Projects, Contact)
* `widgets/` — reusable UI components
* `models/` — data models used in the app
* `services/` — APIs, helpers, or providers
* `utils/` — shared utility functions

**Recommendation:** Keep `lib/` modular. Use small widgets and split large files into folder modules.

### `Assets/` (case-sensitive on some systems)

Contains images, icons and font files. Ensure `pubspec.yaml` lists these under `flutter:` → `assets:` and `fonts:` so they are bundled.

Example `pubspec.yaml` snippets:

```yaml
flutter:
  assets:
    - Assets/images/profile.png
    - Assets/icons/

  fonts:
    - family: Inter
      fonts:
        - asset: Assets/fonts/Inter-Regular.ttf
```

### `analysis_options.yaml`

This file configures lints and style rules. Keep it in repo to maintain consistent code quality. You can enable packages such as `flutter_lints` or `pedantic`.

### Platform folders (`android/`, `ios/`, `web/`, `windows/`, `macos/`, `linux/`)

These are generated/managed by Flutter. For normal app development you rarely need to edit them directly — only when you need to add native integrations, change bundles, or configure platform-specific settings.

## Assets & dependencies

* Keep images under `Assets/` and reference them from code like:

```dart
Image.asset('Assets/images/my_image.png')
```

* To add a package dependency, update `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`.

Example:

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.2
  url_launcher: ^6.0.20
```

## Testing

Add tests under `test/` and run:

```bash
flutter test
```

Write widget tests for UI components and unit tests for pure logic.

## Building & releasing

### Android

* Update `android/app/build.gradle` version info.
* Build with `flutter build apk` or `flutter build appbundle`.
* Sign the app using a keystore for Play Store releases.

### iOS

* Build and archive using Xcode (macOS + Xcode required).
* Make sure provisioning profiles and signing are set up.

### Web

* `flutter build web` produces `build/web/` artifacts you can host on any static host.

### Desktop

* Enable desktop support if necessary: `flutter config --enable-windows-desktop` (Windows), similarly for macOS/Linux.
* `flutter build windows|macos|linux` produces platform-specific executables.

## Code style & linting

* Enforce lints via `analysis_options.yaml` and prefer a consistent style (2-space indentation for Dart, prefer `const` where possible).
* Consider configuring a GitHub Action or CI to run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` on PRs.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feat/my-feature`.
3. Make changes and add tests where applicable.
4. Run `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` locally.
5. Open a pull request with a clear description.

**Coding tips:**

* Keep widgets small and composable.
* Prefer `StatelessWidget` where state is not required.
* Document public classes and functions with dartdoc comments (`///`).

## Common troubleshooting

* If assets are missing: ensure paths are correct in `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`.
* If platform build fails: run `flutter doctor -v` and follow the tool's suggestions.
